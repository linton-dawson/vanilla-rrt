# vanilla-rrt
Basic rrt algorithm implementation

## Instructions :-

* Enter starting co-ordinates
* Enter goal co-ordinates
* Enter number of rrt iterations (iteratiosn directly proportional to probability of reaching the goal(mostly) )
* Enter number of obstacles (considering the object as a line segment)
* Enter co-ordinates of a line segment

Final answer will either be when the goal is reached or rrt iterations completed.
